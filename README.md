# Valve Mod
  WIP Minecraft mod for 1.12.2 implementing features from Valve games.
  Don't get too excited. I'm no iChun, but I hope to compliment his mods greatly
  by adding things that were either never in his mods, or removed at some point.  
  If you catch your assets uploaded to my repository, it's most likely by mistake, I'm using other assets only as placeholders.
  Contact me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ha1otroop2288) to get it removed, or I'll remove it as soon as it's noticed.
